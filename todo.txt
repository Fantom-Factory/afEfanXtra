DONE: bug fix - refresh templates twice

For 1.1.0
=========

Have render methods return Void...???

For Future
==========

Make TemplateFinders public when no-longer file reliant - use EfanTemplateSource

Add EfanTemlapteNameMapper / Matcher for *Page / *Component

Make efan compilation optional - just have a render() method instead



Naa - It's a Bad Idea
=====================

Don't have events / method callers in efanXtra - it should be purely templating 
 - by all means have hooks to call methods but no more
