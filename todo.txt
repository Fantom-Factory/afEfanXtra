For 1.1.8
=========



For Future
==========
Have render methods return Void...???

Make TemplateFinders public ???

Add EfanTemlapteNameMapper / Matcher for *Page / *Component



Naa - It's a Bad Idea
=====================

Don't have events / method callers in efanXtra - it should be purely templating 
 - by all means have hooks to call methods but no more
