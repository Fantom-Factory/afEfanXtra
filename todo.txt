For 1.0.0
=========

FIXME: NEED to supress rendering! return false from beforeRender?

Make TemplateFinders public when no-longer file reliant - use EfanTemplateSource

Add EfanTemlapteNameMapper / Matcher for *Page / *Component

Make efan compilation optional - just have a render() method instead
 - implement a render mixin - then compile against a known efan which just calls render() 

Change the class names...?
 - EfanComponentLibraries
 - EfanComponentCache

What's with the Component mixin? 
 - what of initialise()?
 - what of beforeRender()?
 - what of afterRender()?

Don't have events / method callers in efanExtra - it should be purely templating 
 - by all means have hooks to call methods but no more

For Future
