v2.0
****
Core parts re-written to allow standard classes and const classes to be used as components (they're no longer just for mixins!). This allows a much more natural style of Fantom programming with efan components. The rendering process has also been significanly simplified for a speedier result.

v2.0.6
======
 - Chg: Optimised the common Template finders.
 - Bug: Pods could not be contributed as EfanLibraries more than once.
 - Bug: Nested components, each with a body fn, could cause a 'StackOverflowErr'.

v2.0.4
======
 - Chg: Renamed the, now unused, render method variable 'ctx' to '_ctx_' to prevent clashes with component field names.

v2.0.2
======
 - Chg: efanXtra now references 'EfanCompiler' by ID so other non-efanXtra IoC instances may be created.

v2.0.0
======
 - New: Re-written for efan 2.0.
 - Chg: Updated all pods to latest versions.



v1.0
****

v1.2.0
======
 - New: Fandoc Type comments may also be used as templates.
 - Chg: Updated to work with [IoC v3]`pod:afIoc`. (Breaking Change.)
 - Chg: 'TemplateConverters' now takes contributions of '|Str->Str|'. (Breaking Change.)
 - Chg: Baseclass names are also used to find templates.
 - Chg: Each component renders into it's own 'StrBuf'. This allows us to render arbitrary, non-nested, components and embed the result in template Strs.

v1.1.20
=======
 - Chg: Better handling of threaded services / dependency provided objects injected into components.

v1.1.18
=======
 - Chg: Advanced API change to accomodate @Inject'ed threaded services.
 - Bug: efanXtra now honours the '@Autobuild' facet.

v1.1.16
=======
 - Chg: Renamed '@EfanLocation' -> '@TemplateLocation'. (Oops!)

v1.1.14
=======
 - New: Added a couple of library methods to 'EfanXtra'.
 - Chg: Updated to [IoC 2.0.0]`pod:afIoc`.
 - Chg: Renamed '@EfanTemplate' -> '@EfanLocation'. (Breaking change.)
 - Chg: Internal work to lazily compile 'EfanLibraries'.

v1.1.12
=======
 - Chg: Removed 'ArgNotFoundErr' in favour of the one in [Bean Utils]`pod:afBeanUtils`.
 - Chg: Updated to [IoC 1.7.6]`pod:afIoc`.

v1.1.10
=======
 - Bug: Bodged release - updated to [IoC 1.7.2]`pod:afIoc`.

v1.1.8
======
 - Chg: Updated to use [IoC 1.7.0]`pod:afIoc`.

v1.1.6
======
 - Chg: Updated to use [IoC 1.6.4]`pod:afIoc`, added dependency on [IoC Env 1.0.6]`pod:afIocEnv`
 - Chg: 'EfanXtraConfigIds.templateTimeout' now defaults to '2min' in production environments, and '2sec' otherwise.
 - Chg: Removed 'EfanXtraConfigIds.supressStartupLogging'. To suppress the startup log, remove the 'RegistryStartup' contribution 'afEfanXtra.logLibraries'.

v1.1.4
======
 - Chg: Updated to use [Concurrent 1.0.4]`pod:afConcurrent`.
 - Chg: (Internal) Created 'ComponentRenderer'.
 - Bug: Could not re-compile components.

v1.1.2
======
 - Chg: Updated to use [efan 1.4.0]`pod:afIoc`.

v1.1.0
======
 - New: Template files are optional! Small components may just override 'renderTemplate()' instead.
 - Chg: Overhauled and tidied up the public API and documentation. (Breaking change.)
 - Chg: Type checks involving Lists and Maps are more lenient when calling lifecycle methods.

v1.0.14
=======
 - Chg: Updated to use [IoC 1.6.0]`pod:afIoc` and [Concurrent 1.0.0]`pod:afConcurrent`.

v1.0.12
=======
 - Chg: Components may now have threaded services injected into them!

v1.0.10
=======
 - New: Added 'EfanLibraries.callMethod()' hook for [Pillow]`pod:afPillow`.
 - Chg: Components automatically 'use' the pod that the component mixin was defined in.
 - Chg: 'ComponentCompiler' callbacks now take the component type.
 - Chg: 'FindEfanByFacetValue' is public for use by [Pillow]`pod:afPillow`.
 - Chg: Render methods are searched for on the component *instance*, not just the mixin. This is so it may still be called if it's added dynamically.

v1.0.8
======
 - New: 'fandoc' files may be used as efan templates!

v1.0.6
======
 - Chg: Upgraded to [Ioc 1.5.0]`pod:afIoc`.
 - Chg: Upgraded to [Ioc Config 1.0.0]`pod:afIocConfig`.

v1.0.4
======
 - Chg: '@InitMethods' may now only return 'Void' or 'Bool'. Throw
 [BedSheet's]`pod:afBedSheet` 'ReProcessErr' if you wish to perform a different action.
 - Chg: Multiple components may now share the same template file.

 - Chg: Overhauled API documentation.
 - Chg: Tweaked some method signatures with correct nullable types.

   & [AfterRender]`AfterRender`.
 - New: Added '@Abstract' facet to mark base components.
 - Chg: Template rendering is held in a single mutable 'StrBuf' so it may be manipulated by lifecycle methods.
 - Chg: Components are now defined by extending 'EfanComponent', not by annotating with a '@Component' facet.
 - Chg: Renamed to 'efanXtra' (from 'efanExtra').

v0.0.8

 - New: Compilation err msgs are updated with code hints should a simple component rendering typo be spotted. (ALIEN-AID)

 - New: Component templates can be specified via the '@Component.template' field.
 - New: Added a contributable 'EfanTemplateFinders' service.
 - New: Ability to suppress startup log messages.
 - New: Added compiler hooks (mainly for [Pillow]`pod:afPillow`).
